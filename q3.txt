To test login page as given in the figure, the test scenarios I need to examine are as follows:

a. To verify if the user can login with valid username and password.
b. To verify if a validation message is displayed or not while submitting both fields or any one field blank.
c. To verify if a validation message is displayed while the user logs in with invalid credentials, and should not be logged in.
d. To test if the login page consists input field, password field, forgot password button and login button.
e. To test if the password is sent plain or encrypted after the login button is clicked.
f. To check if the user is previously logged in or not. If logged in the user must not be shown the login page again.
g. As a security, verify that the password cannot be copied nor be pasted.
h. Verify if SQL injection doesnot work in login page.
